Plan: create a webpage that members can share their own cooking experiences

Tools: ruby on rails, html, css and javascript

Sore bits: It was really pain when I want to add more functions to the project. Sometimes it turned to be a "fix-bug journey".

Where next?
1. Create the functions for different users that they can view all the menu but they can only edit or delete their own;
2. Update the database and fix the bug that if there is now one create the menu (seed), it still can be viewed;
3. fix the text design which could block into lines by using some bullets;
4. More css practices;
5. API and GEM! If possible, I wish I can use some APIs or gems in the project. I did't practice any API or gem;

What I learned?
1. How to set, get and post the value in a table;
2. Basic knowledge of using ruby on rails and related tools;
3. specific codes: "textarea" and "email.index[0, '@']".


This is Version 1. The new version is coming soon.
